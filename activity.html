            <br />
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">
               The talk was hosted at a spacious room in the Lexington Community Center. A zoom meeting was also started for online viewers. 
               Dr. Huang invited everyone to take a google form as a warm up and a icebreaker to the topics she was going to talk about. 
               After, she went over the answers and some reasoning to why they were correct. Dr. Huang's talk was extremely informative and covered many important topics, such as Social Media Health, AI, and the future of medicare. The talk ended with a fun trivia game hosted by William and Emma. 
               The game consisted of teams writing their answers to the quesiton on whiteboards and holding them up at once. 
               When they got it correct, they were able to send someone up to shoot a ball into a small cup. Everyone had a blast with the game, and winners went home with some candy as prizes.

                <p class="text-muted mb-0">
                    On April 23rd, 2022, the Chinese American Association of Lexington (CAAL) Youth STEAM Initiative sent 3 representatives–Baoren Liu, David Zhao, and William Zhang–to showcase the
                    organization’s past and ongoing civic service projects and initiatives to compete for a helpful grant offered by the Emerging Leaders in Civic Action Mini-Grant Pitching Event.
                    The event was organized by the <a href="https://www.nclacademy.org/" target="_blank">Civic Leadership Academy</a>, a national organization dedicated towards fostering
                    passionate young leaders to design and run community initiatives centered around the principles of civic engagement and community reformations. The grant included an initial
                    seed fund of $500, mentor-led workshops on 6/25/2022, 7/23/2022, and 8/20/2022, along with additional guidance and leadership development training sessions. Our team was also
                    invited to showcase our completed projects in the Annual Emerging Leaders in Civic Action Showcase event (in collaboration with the United Chinese Americans, or
                    <a href="https://ucausa.org/" target="_blank">UCA</a>) from July 14-16, 2022. <br /><br />
                    Here are the slides we presented in the competition:

                <h4 class="mt-0">Preparation</h4>
                <hr />
                <p class="text-muted mb-0">
                    Preparation for the presentation began in early February of 2022, when the team met together numerous times to devise optimal pre-screening round application paragraphs for the
                    subteams’ various community impact-based projects. This was followed by preparation of a set of slides to showcase the team’s accomplishments and ongoing initiatives,
                    highlighting the following projects:<br /><br />
                </p>

                <ul class="dashed mb-0">
                    <li><b> Rediscovering Lexington’s Heroes</b> <i>(In collaboration with the Lexington Town Government)</i></li>
                    <li><b> Spoken Wise</b> <i>(In collaboration with the Lexington Cary Memorial Library)</i></li>
                    <li><b> Lunar Arts Website Restoration</b> <i>(In collaboration with New Moon International)</i><br /><br /></li>
                </ul>

                <p class="text-muted mb-0">
                    The team also decided on a split-project presentation format, opening up with a brief overview of all the initiatives organized by the subteams of the CAAL Youth STEAM Initiative
                    organization.

                    This was subsequently added on by detailed slides explaining the actionable steps taken and planned by each individual subteam on their respective projects, along with the

                    The prepared slides and showcase section concluded with a riveting description of how the projects would impact the community, and the presenting members all explained how the

                    Presentation day, as always, was intensive and fast-paced, with the judges asking difficult questions for the team to answer and explain their well-planned solutions to. There
                    were numerous good points raised by the grant application judges in the presentations given by all teams to ensure a rigorously decided result for the grant award and
                    placements. At the end of the presentation, David, Baoren, and William all believed that the CAAL Youth STEAM Initiative showcased the full extent of their community outreach
                    projects and their outstanding applications of various software development skill sets in creating change and reformation in their community. A few weeks later, results were
                    released for the Emerging Leaders in Civic Action Mini-Grant Pitching Event.

                    The CAAL Youth STEAM Initiative had won the 1st place award in the placements, and had become the recipient of the 2022 Emerging Leaders in Civic Action Grant, enabling the
                    organization to further its initiatives in utilizing the technologies of the information age to build extraordinary tools to help improve the community of Lexington and beyond.
                    We would like to extend its thanks to the Civic Leadership Academy and its affiliates for providing this unique opportunity for the CAAL Youth STEAM Initiative, and hope that this
                    opportunity will help us aid the community even further in providing digital solutions to various public works initiatives of the team.

                <p class="text-muted mb-0">
                    The Youth STEAM Initiative participated in the 2022 Patriots Day Parade with the aim of spreading their contributions to the community. David Zhao, Cassidy Xu and Ashley
                    Zhang helped hold advertising banners for local businesses, while William Zhang and Kevin Zhu volunteered to hold the CAAL banner. Irene Gao and Ethan Shao proudly held the
                    team’s poster. The atmosphere was lively and invigorating as the STEAM Team and other members of CAAL were showered with applause from the audience.

                <p class="text-muted mb-0">
                    The team lead for this activity was Ivy Tang, who communicated with the team and designed the team poster with the help of her friend Hannah Guo. They incorporated aspects of
                    the American flag in the poster, and added names of the team’s past projects in flowers along with a computer. This symbolized the blooming of contributions to the community
                    with the aid of technology. Ultimately, the team was able to successfully publicize themselves and convey the hard work of each member.<br /><br />
